Getting real users in front of any product/project you build is completely essential. Every time you watch real users interact with what you build you'll get invaluable insights about what's difficult to use, what makes sense, and where users are struggling. Unfortunately, if you're just working as a solo developer on a side project getting real users in front of your project can be extremely difficult and time-consuming. Finding potential testers on the cheap might mean sending hundreds of unsolicited emails, or doing socially-terrifying things like acosting strangers in Starbucks offering a gift card for testing your app. No sane person wants to do these things!

Fortunately, you can get a lot of the benefits of user testing quickly and easily by using Facebook ads to get some small amount of users onto your project. Facebook's ad targetting, which is terrifying as a user of Facebook, is amazing if you're trying to buy ads. Want to get some lawyers to check out a project you're working on? Easy. Need some foreign language teachers to test out a new idea you have? No problem. You can target a few dollars worth of ads at your target market, and within a day have 10 - 100 real users on your site. As an added benefit, these are real users who have no idea what your project is or who you are, so their interactions with what you've built are representative of users in the wild. 

## Analytics

For users that reach your project via Facebook, you can't watch them interact with your site in person. You can do the next best thing, though, and track loads of user events via analytics so you can get a sense of what users do once they land on your page. I like to use Heap analytics for this purpose since it allows you to see every click and interaction users do on your site without needing much explicit setup, but any event-driven analytics service should work. Since your project should just have a few users at this point, any analytics you use should typically be free as well.

## Test value propositions and headlines

Gettig users onto your project via ads has an added bonus of allowing you to test which pitches resonate most with your target users. You can try highlighting different features in each ad group and see which performs the best. Then, you can take those learnings to adjust your homepage and 

## Bonus: Ad interactions and sharing

Most Facebook ads take the form of a post which users can interact with just like any normal post in their feed. This includes commenting on your ad, reacting to it, and sharing it. Facebook will notify you when this happens, so you can go and view what users commented on your ad and you can even engage with a conversation with the users in comments. This can give great insight into what users are thinking when they view your project. For example, in the comments for an ad below, clearly there needs to be better messaging around the security of what they users are entering:

<img src="/assets/user_fb_ad_comment.png" alt="Oops, looks like this project needs better messaging around data security" />

Without being able to see when users react negatively, this user would just drop off the site and you wouldn't have any way to know why.

## What about other ad platforms?

I haven't had as much success using Google ads or other ad platforms to get traffic for user testing to my side projects, but I'm also far from an expert on digital marketing. Definitely try other platforms, and see what works best for you! However you do it, getting real users in front of projects you build is essential.

## Happy User Testing!
