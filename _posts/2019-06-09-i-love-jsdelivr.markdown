[Jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) doesn't get nearly as much attention as it deserves, so here's my small attempt to remedy that. I absolutely love jsdelivr. It's a CDN that works globally, *including China* for opensource projects, and it's completely free. It's hard to overstate awesome that is.

Getting things to work in China even after paying a lot of money is [really hard](https://chanind.github.io/china/2019/01/19/launching-an-app-or-website-in-china.html), yet jsdelivr just works - instantly. You don't even have to explicitly publish anything! If it's on npm, it's already on jsdelivr. It's currently powering the data delivery side of [Hanzi Writer](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer), and without it I don't think that project would be anywhere near as useful.

So thank you Jsdelivr, I love you!
