Hi, I'm David, a full stack developer working at [EF Hello](https://efhello.com) in London. I've previously lived in Shanghai, New York, and San Francisco. I'm the maintainer of
[Hanzi Writer](https://chanind.github.io/hanzi-writer), a javascript library
for Chinese character stroke animations and quizzes, and I built [Wordsheet.io](https://wordsheet.io) as well.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/chanind), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidchanin), or by email at [chanindav@gmail.com](mailto:chanindav@gmail.com).
