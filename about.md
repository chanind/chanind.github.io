Hi, I'm David, a PhD student at UCL in London under [Anthony Hunter](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/A.Hunter/) and [Oana-Maria Camburu](https://sites.google.com/view/oana-maria-camburu/) working on common-sense reasoning and mechanistic interpretability. In a previous life I worked as a full-stack software engineer in San Francisco, Shanghai, and London.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/chanind), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidchanin), or by email at [chanindav@gmail.com](mailto:chanindav@gmail.com).
