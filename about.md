Hi, I'm David, a full stack developer currently working at EF in London. I've previously
lived in Shanghai, New York, and San Francisco. I'm also the maintainer of
[Hanzi Writer](https://chanind.github.io/hanzi-writer), a javascript library
for Chinese character stroke animations and quizzes, and I built [Wordsheet.io](https://wordsheet.io) as well.
