Hi, I'm David, a full stack developer working at [EF Hello](https://efhello.com) in London. I've previously lived in Shanghai, New York, and San Francisco. I'm the maintainer of
[Hanzi Writer](https://hanziwriter.org), a javascript library
for Chinese character stroke animations and quizzes.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/chanind), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidchanin), or by email at [chanindav@gmail.com](mailto:chanindav@gmail.com).

### Work with me!
I'm interested in doing a PhD in ML/AI in 2022, and would love to work with
researchers doing work in the meantime. Please reach out at
[chanindav@gmail.com](mailto:chanindav@gmail.com) if you have a
project I can be a part of.
